# paths-of-thought

Different ways of thinking, one search for understanding.

This project is a simple educational website that introduces six major philosophical traditions using HTML5 and CSS3.  
It was created as a beginner web development assignment focused on semantic structure, layout, and visual styling.

## Project Purpose

The aim of this project was to build a webpage using semantic HTML structure, responsive layout techniques, and text overlay styling.

### Objectives Achieved

- Use of semantic HTML tags, including `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`
- Navigation styled using CSS Flexbox to create a responsive layout
- Text overlaid on background images using CSS absolute positioning
- Background images implemented correctly using valid file paths

---

## User Stories Achieved

- The webpage contains a clear structure with a recognisable header, navigation, main content, and footer.
- The navigation links are organised using a responsive layout created with Flexbox.
- Text is overlaid on images in a visually clear manner using CSS absolute positioning.
- Background images load correctly and display properly on the webpage.

## Stretch Features Completed

- Added a “Back to Top” link on every section
- Added hover effects to make interactive elements more noticeable
- Highlighted section titles using CSS IDs
- Created a unique manuscript-inspired visual design

## Reflection

I achieved all of the required user stories in this assignment. The webpage includes a clear semantic structure, a responsive navigation layout, and positioned text overlays on background images.

I also implemented stretch features such as a “Back to Top” link, interactive hover effects, and a distinctive design theme. Working with absolute positioning was challenging at first because the positioning of text over images affected responsiveness. I resolved this by adjusting positioning and spacing.

One improvement I would like to learnt is enhancing full mobile responsiveness.

Overall, this project helped me practise semantic HTML, Flexbox layout, fixed positioning, image styling, and visually engaging CSS techniques.
